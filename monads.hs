-- OK we did it!!
-- Let's see now some applications: The interestin part of the whole Monad thing is the fact that the function (a -> Logger b) can do and be ANYTHING

-- Define a function that takes a number,add one and log the operation
-- Define a function that takes a number, Add ones, Builds up the Monadic Action

logAddOne:: (Num a) => a -> Logger b
logaddOne x = Logger (x+1, ["+1"])

-- Define a function taking a number, multiplying it for 2 and building up tha monadic action
logMultTwo:: (Num a) => a -> Logger b
logMultTwo x = Logger (x * 2, ["*2"])


-- OK!!! Now, since Logger is a Monad we can use >>=. For syntacti sugar, this is wrapped inside the do { <- } notation


-- Define a function that takes a logger, adds one, doubles the value and logs all the operations

logOps:: (Num a) => Logger a -> Logger a
logOps log = do
       v <- log -- Binds the logger value to v
       p1 <- logAddOne v
       m2 <- logMultTwo p1
       return m2 --

record:: String -> Logger ()
record s  = Logger ((), [s])









-- Let's do now some trees:



data Tree a = EmptyTree | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show, Eq)

singletonM :: (Show a) => a -> Logger (Tree a)
